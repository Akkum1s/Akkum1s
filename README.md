Beauty Salon Management System
This project is a beauty salon management system implemented in Python using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

# Description
The beauty salon management system allows users to book services (manicure, pedicure, makeup, hair styling, eyelash & brow lamination, etc.) on specific dates and times with selected masters. The project demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create a flexible and modular system.

User Interface:
The project is currently implemented as a text-based interface through the Python console.
